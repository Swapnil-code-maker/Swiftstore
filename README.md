SwiftStore

Multi-Vendor E-Commerce and Delivery Management Platform

SwiftStore is a full-stack web application that simulates a real-world multi-vendor marketplace. The platform connects customers, vendors, and delivery agents within a single system, enabling product management, order processing, and delivery coordination.

The project is built using Flask for backend development and SQLite with SQLAlchemy for database management. It implements role-based authentication, secure session handling, and structured order lifecycle management.
